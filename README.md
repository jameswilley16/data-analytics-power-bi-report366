## Milestone 10 Completed
- Queries were run on the following things using SQL
- How many staff are there in all of the UK stores?
- Which month in 2022 has had the highest revenue?
  - to find the revenue I used REGEXP_REPLACE to remove the Â£ from the product_price then converted it from text to numeric to allow it to be multiplied by the product quantity
  - joined the orders table and the products table by the shared product code column
  - filtered so only orders made in 2022 were shown
  - extracted month from the order date column, column had to be cast as date as the data type was text, this allowed me to group by month
  - Ordered with highest revenue at the top of the column
- Which German store type had the highest revenue for 2022
   - adapted the previous query
   - added dim_stores.country_code = 'DE' to the WHERE statement
   - added an additional join statement, joining dim_stores and orders column by store code
   - Grouped by store_type instead of month
- Create a view where the rows are the store types and the columns are the total sales, percentage of total sales and the count of orders
   - took sales to be revenue
   - ran a main query adapted from the previous queries which found the total revenue grouped by store type
   - ran a subsquery which just calculated the total revenue without it being grouped
   - therefore, (main query/subquery)*100 = percentage of sales for that store type
- Which product category generated the most profit for the "Wiltshire, UK" region in 2021?
   - Instead of profit I used revenue again as I couldn't find the cost of the product to take off the price they were sold for.
   - adapted from the other queries with the WHERE statement being amended accordingly
